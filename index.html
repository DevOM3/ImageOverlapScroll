      <p class="information">
        Grand Teton, home to the 4,000-meter Grand Teton peak, is tops for
        mountain sports, spectacular scenery and a plethora of wildlife,
        including plenty of grizzly bears and black bears. To catch a glimpse of
        the famed wildlife, take a half-day open-air safari tour with an expert
        guide from BrushBuck Wildlife Tours and scout the 300+ bird species and
        more than 60 mammals that call the park home.
        <br />
        Rising above a scene rich with extraordinary wildlife, pristine lakes,
        and alpine terrain, the Teton Range stands as a monument to the people
        who fought to protect it. These are mountains of the imagination.
        Mountains that led to the creation of Grand Teton National Park where
        you can explore over two hundred miles of trails, float the Snake River,
        and enjoy the serenity of this remarkable place.

      <p class="information">
        The Grand Canyon is undoubtedly the nation’s most renowned natural
        wonder and it’s no surprise that Grand Canyon National Park continues to
        rank near the top of the list in popularity. The 277-mile canyon is
        visually astounding, with millions of years of geology on display on an
        epic scale that’s only enhanced by its dramatic coloring of enchanting
        reds. Among the most memorable ways to witness part of the canyon’s
        majesty is a Maverick Helicopters tour through Dragon Corridor with
        views of Kaibab National Forest and Painted Desert.

    <main>
      <p class="information">
        Utah’s Zion National Park is a visual wonderland of natural splendor
        including the Emerald Pools and towering red cliffs with plenty of
        stunning hikes to be had. Canyoneering is a top draw at Zion, where at
        least half a dozen canyons are high on the list for many adventure
        seekers. Among the park’s top-rated activities is a UTV and rappelling
        tour of a slot canyon with East Zion Jeep Tours, typically lasting 4-5
        hours and only requiring a moderate level of physical fitness.

    <main>
      <p class="information">
        Home to North America’s tallest peak, Alaska’s Denali National Park
        includes 6 million acres of wilderness, and it’s not even the largest
        national park in the state (that designation belongs to the
        13.2-million-acre Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, and America’s
        largest state is actually home to 7 of the 10 largest national parks).
        Mountaineering is an obvious attraction here, but the glacial landscapes
        and impressive wildlife bring the crowds. With most of the terrain
        completely unmarred by human interference (i.e., don’t expect roads) one
        of the most popular ways to view as many of the park’s magnificent
        landscapes as possible is by bush plane tour with K2 Aviation.
